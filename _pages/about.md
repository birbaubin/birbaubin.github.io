PhD student and computer engineer, I firmly believe that information technologies can contribute to building a better world. 

I contribute by focusing on machine learning, information security, and ways to create secure intelligent systems. My research interests include privacy, robustness, and security in machine learning.

I am currently working on my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Marc-Olivier Killijian](https://kirija.github.io/) and [Prof. Sébastien Gambs](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/gambs.sebastien/).
