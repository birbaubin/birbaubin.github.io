I am a PhD student and computer engineer passionate about harnessing information technologies to help build a better world.

My work centers on machine learning and information security, with a particular interest in developing secure and intelligent systems. I am especially interested in the application of cryptographic tools such as homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation and classical cryptographic primitives for privacy in intelligent systems. I also have a keen interest and demonstrating the limitations of secure protocols, and providing solutions to achieve robustness and security in these systems.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Marc-Olivier Killijian](https://kirija.github.io/) and [Prof. Sébastien Gambs](https://professeurs.uqam.ca/professeur/gambs.sebastien/).
