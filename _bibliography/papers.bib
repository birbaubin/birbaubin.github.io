abstract = {Cryptographic approaches, such as secure multiparty computation, can be used to securely compute a function of a distributed graph without centralizing the data of each participant. However, the output of the protocol can leak sensitive information about the structure of the original graph. In particular, we propose an approach by which an adversary observing the result of a private protocol for the computation of the number of common neighbors between all pairs of vertices, can reconstruct the adjacency matrix of the graph. In fact, this can only be done up to co-squareness, a notion we introduce, as two different graphs can have the same matrix of common neighbors. To realize this, we consider two adversary models, one who observes the common neighbors matrix only and a more informed one that has partial knowledge of the original graph. Our results demonstrate that, from their common neighbors matrix, graphs can be reconstructed with high accuracy (up to co-squareness). The proposed reconstruction is also interesting in itself from the point of view of graph theory.},

abstract = {Graphs are a widely used data structure for collecting and analyzing relational data. However, when the graph structure is distributed across several parties, its analysis is challenging. In particular, due to the sensitivity of the data each party might want to keep their partial knowledge of the graph private, while still be willing to collaborate with the other parties for tasks of mutual benefit, such as data curation or the removal of poisoned data. To address this challenge, we propose Crypto'Graph, an efficient protocol for privacy-preserving link prediction on distributed graphs. More precisely, it allows parties partially sharing a graph with distributed links to infer the likelihood of formation of new links in the future. Through the use of cryptographic primitives, Crypto'Graph is able to compute the likelihood of these new links on the joint network without revealing the structure of the private graph of each party, even though they know the number of nodes they have, since they share the same graph in terms of nodes but not the same links. Crypto'Graph improves on previous works by enabling the computation of a diverse set of similarity metrics in parallel without any additional cost. The use of Crypto'Graph is illustrated for defense against graph poisoning attacks, in which potential adversarial links are identified without compromising the privacy of the graphs of individual parties. The effectiveness of Crypto'Graph in mitigating graph poisoning attacks and achieving high prediction accuracy on a node classification task using graph neural networks is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on two real-world datasets.},

Instead, RevoLUT leverages LUTs as first class objects, enabling efficient oblivious operations such as array access, elements sorting and permutation directly within the table. This approach supports oblivious algortithm, providing a secure, privacy-preserving solution for handling sensitive data in various applications.},

      abstract = {Cloud storage offers convenient data access and sharing, but security concerns remain. Existing secure cloud storage solutions often lack essential features like data integrity, multi-cloud support, user-friendly file sharing, and efficient search. This paper proposes a novel secure cloud storage system that addresses these limitations. Our system uses distributed storage and attribute-based encryption to enhance data availability, access control, and user experience. It also enables private and efficient file search and data retrievability verification. This approach overcomes the trade-offs present in prior work, offering a secure and user-friendly solution for cloud data management.},

      year = {2025},
      url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1409},
      abstract = {While the use of homomorphic encryption (HE) for
encrypted inference has received considerable attention, its
application for the training of machine learning (ML) models
remains comparatively underexplored, primarily due to the
high computational overhead traditionally associated with fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE). In this work, we address
this challenge by leveraging the inherent connection between
inference and training in the context of Extremely Randomized
Trees (ERT), thereby enabling efficient training directly over
encrypted data. More precisely, we instantiate this approach
by the training of ERT within the TFHE framework. Our
implementation demonstrates that it is possible to train ERTs
on encrypted datasets with a runtime significantly lower than
current state-of-the-art methods for training Random Forests
in the encrypted domain while achieving comparable predictive
accuracy. This result highlights a promising direction for
practical privacy-preserving machine learning using FHE. Our
second main contribution consists in leveraging the properties
of ERTs to create the first ML model that enables private
unlearning. This approach makes the unlearning process indistinguishable from training, thus allowing clients to conceal
the true nature of the operations being conducted on the model.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
